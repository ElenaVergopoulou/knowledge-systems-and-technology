This project is about the creation of an ontology about the transport means. The ontology is very wide, however we didn't have the respective data so in the implementation we used only data regarding the bus, subways and trolleys in Athens. For this section we used the GTFS prototype and enriched it with more classes and data properties.

We did the impremenation using the tool Protege and we divided the classes between publc and private transport means.
We added the domains, ranges and the object properties.
